Hello!

Car Media Control is a personal project in which i implemented a few basic functions of a car that can be controlled by the use of our hands.

1) Volume control by calculating the distance between the index finger and the thumb.
2) Next track feature used by closing the distance between the index finger and the thumb.
3) Previous track feature used by closing the distance between the pinky finger and the thumb.

To differentiate between the volume control and the next track gesture i used a threshold value.

Thank you!
